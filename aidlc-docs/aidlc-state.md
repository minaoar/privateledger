# AI-DLC State Tracking

## Project Information
- **Project Type**: Brownfield
- **Start Date**: 2026-08-17T05:48:26Z
- **Current Stage**: CONSTRUCTION - UOW-1 Code Generation Part 3 Handoff
- **Branch**: support-mcc-for-category

## Workspace State
- **Existing Code**: Yes
- **Programming Languages**: Go, HTML templates, JavaScript
- **Build System**: Make + Go modules
- **Project Structure**: Monolith (single Go binary, clean architecture)
- **Workspace Root**: /Users/tanzil/Documents/GitHub/privateledger

## Code Location Rules
- **Application Code**: Workspace root (NEVER in aidlc-docs/)
- **Documentation**: aidlc-docs/ only

## Extension Configuration
| Extension | Enabled | Decided At |
|---|---|---|
| security-baseline | No | Requirements Analysis |
| property-based-testing | Partial | Requirements Analysis |
| resiliency-baseline | No | Requirements Analysis |

## Requirement Analysis Summary
- **User Request**: Plan GitHub issue #5 — auto-categorize transactions based on SIC/MCC values found under OFX/QFX `<SIC>` tags.
- **Request Type**: New Feature / Enhancement
- **Initial Scope Estimate**: Multiple Components (parser, model, database schema/migration, repositories, categorizer service, handlers/API, categories UI, tests)
- **Initial Complexity Estimate**: Moderate
- **Status**: Requirements approved and INCEPTION completed; CONSTRUCTION is in progress for UOW-1

## Stage Progress

### 🔵 INCEPTION PHASE
- [x] Workspace Detection
- [x] Reverse Engineering — SKIPPED (prior architecture artifact exists and existing code was inspected for issue #5 impact)
- [x] Requirements Analysis — COMPLETED
- [x] User Stories — COMPLETED
- [x] Workflow Planning — COMPLETED
- [x] Application Design — COMPLETED
- [x] Units Generation — COMPLETED

### 🟢 CONSTRUCTION PHASE
- [x] Functional Design — COMPLETED FOR UOW-1
- [x] NFR Requirements — COMPLETED FOR UOW-1
- [x] NFR Design — COMPLETED FOR UOW-1
- [ ] Infrastructure Design — SKIP
- [ ] Code Generation — EXECUTE (ALWAYS)
- [ ] Build and Test — EXECUTE (ALWAYS)

### 🟡 OPERATIONS PHASE
- [ ] Operations — PLACEHOLDER

## Current Status
- **Lifecycle Phase**: CONSTRUCTION
- **Current Unit**: UOW-1 — SIC Import and Storage
- **Current Stage**: Code Generation Part 3 — UOW-1 production Revision 2 awaiting independent re-review
- **Last Completed**: Production fixes for independent findings F-01, F-02, and F-03; unchanged independent suite passes
- **Next Step**: Commit Production Revision 2, then have the separate-provider independent role re-review it and update `aidlc-docs/construction/sic-import-and-storage/code-review/independent-review.md`
- **Status**: Prior gate PASS applied to revision 513e23b; material production fixes require a fresh PASS before Code Generation can complete

## Notes
- Production code and verification tests have mandatory cross-provider ownership. Each role runs in a separate session, the handoff is manual and artifact-based, and the independent review must report PASS before Code Generation completes.
- Application design artifacts were reviewed against software engineering best practices, implementation simplicity, and the existing codebase on 2026-08-24; 10 resolutions were applied (see the Design Review Resolutions table in `application-design.md`).
- Three requirement amendments (FR4 x2, FR11) were approved by the user and applied to `requirements.md` on 2026-08-24; affected `stories.md` acceptance criteria were aligned. FR11 is now digits-only, which also removed the SIC collation decision from the design. FR13 needed no change — it already specified the single upload endpoint.
- Previous AI-DLC artifacts for the uncategorized dashboard work were archived to `aidlc-docs/archive/show-uncategorized-dashboard-2026-08-17/` before starting this issue-specific workflow.
